                    <p>
                        Listen up brothers and sisters,<br>
                        come hear my desperate tale.<br>
                        I speak of our friends of nature,<br>
                        trapped in the dirt like a jail.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vegetables live in oppression,<br>
                        served on our tables each night.<br>
                        This killing of veggies is madness,<br>
                        I say we take up the fight.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Salads are only for murderers,<br>
                        coleslaw's a fascist regime.<br>
                        Don't think that they don't have feelings,<br>
                        just cause a radish can't scream.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Chorus:</strong> <br>
                        I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream, scream, scream) <br>
                        Watching their skins being peeled (having their insides revealed) <br>
                        Grated and steamed with no mercy (burning off calories) <br>
                        How do you think that feels (bet it hurts really bad) <br>
                        Carrot juice constitutes murder (and that's a real crime) <br>
                        Greenhouses prisons for slaves (let my vegetables go) <br>
                        It's time to stop all this gardening (it's dirty as hell) <br>
                        Let's call a spade a spade (is a spade is a spade is a spade) <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I saw a man eating celery,<br>
                        so I beat him black and blue.<br>
                        If he ever touches a sprout again,<br>
                        I'll bite him clean in two.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a political prisoner,<br>
                        trapped in a windowless cage.<br>
                        Cause I stopped the slaughter of turnips<br>
                        by killing five men in a rage<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I told the judge when he sentenced me,<br>
                        This is my finest hour,<br>
                        I'd kill those farmers again<br>
                        just to save one more cauliflower.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        How low as people do we dare to stoop,<br>
                        Making young broccolis bleed in the soup?<br>
                        Untie your beans, uncage your tomatoes<br>
                        Let potted plants free, don't mash that potato!<br>
                    </p>

                        Grated and steamed with no mercy (you fat gourmet slob)<br>
                        How do you think that feels? (leave them out in the field)<br>
                        Carrot juice constitutes murder (V8's genocide)<br>
                        Greenhouses prisons for slaves (yes, your composts are graves)<br>
                        It's time to stop all this gardening (take up macrame)<br>
